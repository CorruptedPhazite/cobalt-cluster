# cobalt-cluster: A Complete Rewrite of Cobalt Botterfly [WIP]

This is a rewrite of Cobalt, the bot of the Discord server
[Star vs. the Forces of Discord](https://discord.gg/svtfoe). It uses my [Cluster](https://github.com/410757864530-dead-salmonids/cluster) framework, along with some new hopefully-more-efficient
coding practices that I didn't follow beforehand.

It is currently still a work in progress -- any crystals (modules) that are complete are found in
[the main branch](src/crystals/main), and any crystals that are unfinished (in progress or
not started) are in [the dev branch](src/crystals/dev).

Note: Because this is a very server specific Discord bot, the code hasn't been tested beyond syntax
errors; after finishing the first version, more revisions may be needed.

You can find me on the SVTFOE server, I'm `410,757,864,530 DEAD SALMONIDS#0659`.
